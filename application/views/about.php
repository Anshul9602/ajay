            Ajay Diam Ltd was incorporated in 2004 in Hong Kong which is the primary place for business. It is
            primarily in the business of trading in polished and rough diamonds
            and through its associate company is also in the wholesale business of diamond studded gold Jewellery.
            Prior to incorporation the business operated as Ajay Diam
            having commenced in 1997 and its sole director having 30 years of experience. The major part of the
            company's sales comprises small to very small diamonds
            (50-1000 per carat) to watchmakers and Jewellery manufacturers with our company being one of the few in
            this niche area. The company has an excellent track
            record in both customer and staff retention. We have a respectable client-base of prestigious watch
            makers and jewelers and with our recent certification with the
            Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) we are confident of expanding our client-base and sales in the
            coming months.
