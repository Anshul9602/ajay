            Polished diamonds make up over 95% of sales in addition to rough diamonds and precious color stones.
            Unlike gold the full range of polished
            diamonds is very diverse keeping in mind the permutations and combinations of size, color and clarity.
            We have created a niche in the global
            market comprising the small (50 per carat) to very small (1000 per carat) though as a business strategy
            we try and fulfill all customer requests. With
            the majority of sales comprising polished diamonds the supply is mainly to customers in Hong Kong and
            internationally including Switzerland,
            Belgium, France, Dubai, USA, Australia, Mauritius, India, China amongst others.

            There are limited competitors in the global market and our strength in sourcing at competitive prices
            and the high quality of customer service with
            attention to detail has given us an edge over many of our competitors for a number of years. We have
            also kept pace with technological
            advancements within the industry investing in high-end synthetic diamond detectors and diamond
            preparation aids such as diamond counting
            machines. Investment in latest technology and industry-recognized business standards gives us an added
            edge over many of our competitors.

            With regard to adhering to global industry standards the company has policies in place to ensure our
            local and global suppliers give an
            undertaking that none of their purchases come from regions that are financed by conflict-diamonds. We
            are also a certified member of the RJC
             which currently only a few competitors have. Most renowned watchmakers and
            jewelers now require suppliers to have
            obtained the RJC certification.
