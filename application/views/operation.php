            Ajay Diam Ltd is based in Hong Kong. It procures most of its polished diamonds from traders and manufacturers in India and all are members of the
            Bharat Diamond Bourse.

        <p style=" max-width: 999px;    text-align: center;">

            100% of diamonds purchased are tested for synthetic diamonds and we give an undertaking of the same to our customers. Due to
            the volumes involved trading in diamonds that range from 50-1000 per carat we have invested in diamond counting machines thus providing both
            speed and accuracy in preparation of purchase orders. Also the company has incorporated a water-tight system to account for daily movement of
            stock which is matched at the end of each day.
